## 📝 Description

This is a flappy bird game made with pygame and [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). The goal of this project is to create an AI that can play the game by itself. The AI is trained using NEAT, which is a genetic algorithm that evolves a population of neural networks over time. The game is made with pygame and the NEAT algorithm.
